%DNORM Diamond norm
%   dnorm(J) returns the diamond (completely-bounded induced 1-norm) of a
%            Choi matrix J corresponding to the difference of two CP maps.
%
%   The normalization of J must be such that partial prace of the first
%   half of J always yields the identity for trace preserving
%   superoperators.
